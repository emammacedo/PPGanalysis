# PPG analysis 

The goal was to explore the potential of PPG as a technique for diagnosing autonomic nervous function by studying the relationship between ECG and PPG. This project was conducted for the Clinical Informatics and Telehealth Systems class.

Steps:
1. **Data Collection (private dataset)**: ECG/PPG signals were collected from 10 individuals who experienced both normal and stressful situations.
2. **ECG and PPG Pre-processing.**
3. **ECG and PPG Signal Segmentation**: Segmentation into individual beats using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm.
4. **Extraction of PRV/HRV Measures**: Mean, SDNN, SDSD, RMSSD, NN50, pNN50, and RALH.
5. **Box-plot Analysis**.

Note:
  PPG - Photoplethysmogram
  ECG - Electrocardiogram
  PRV - Pulse Rate Variability
  HRV - Heart Rate Variability
